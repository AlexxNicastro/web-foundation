## Web Workshop

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/Shopify/web-workshop)

This is a 5 hour workshop originally written for RnD Summit 2018. The workshop begins by covering the high-level priciples of the web-foundation team, it then moves on to demonstrate their practical application while coding a private Shopify App that communicates with the Shopify Admin GraphQL API. With a mix of lectures, individual exercises, and live-coding together, the workshop covers the core languages of the Web stack (React, Typescript, GraphQL) as well as our internal libraries (Sewing Kit, Polaris, Quilt).
