This is a 5 hour workshop originally written for RnD Summit 2018. The workshop begins by covering the high-level priciples of the web-foundation team, then demonstrates their practical application while coding a real application. The workshop covers the core languages of the Web stack (React, Typescript, GraphQL) as well as our internal tools and libraries (Sewing Kit, Polaris, Quilt, WebGen).
